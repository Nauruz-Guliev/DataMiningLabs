            This time, I agreed to do part of what Janey wanted.

            We drive around town, searching for the ideal location. Not in front of the Town Hall or the shopping centre, none of the places Janey thinks will make the biggest statement. I think she's been choosing the wrong targets.

            I'm looking for something different. Somewhere on the edge of town would be good. Not the best neighbourhood, but a deprived one, one that the council never invests in. One where the road surface is full of holes, and the pavement looks as if someone smashed it with hammers. I'm looking for somewhere the people don't have cars outside their houses, because no one has the money to own a car.

            We find just the place.

            One night, we arrive in another 'borrowed' truck and carefully fill the whole street with earth from one pavement to the other - classic Janey, just like all her plans. But this time, we plant vegetable gardens in front of every house. We post leaflets through people's doors with gardening instructions, so the lucky new owners will know what to do. The leaflets also explain how much money you can save if you grow your own food - you'd be surprised.

            As a finishing touch, we put grass over those broken old pavements for the kids to play on, complete with a sign reading, 'Please Walk on the Grass'.

            When we've finished, we're both covered in soil and completely exhausted. But Janey puts an arm around my shoulders.\s

            'Not a bad plan, for you!' she says, smiling.""";
